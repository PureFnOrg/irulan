#+TITLE: Command definition and registry

* Problem
  In our CQRS system we need a way to define and describe the inputs to the system - commands.

  There is a 2x2 matrix of possibilities for commands

  |          | Stateless | Stateful |
  |----------+-----------+----------|
  | External |           |          |
  | Internal |           |          |

  The significant implication of stateful processing is those commands may be rejected based on the
  current state of system, and should be written to a failure topic with some description of the
  reason for their failure.  Stateless commands can fail *validation*, but never end up in a topic
  since their structure is invalid.

  External commands are ones which originate outside of our systems, so their structure is
  not controllable.  This means no versioning.  Internal commands can be versioned, have up and down
  casters, and include a provenance.
